If you have any suggestions for the FAQ, make sure to submit them to the form.

# FAQ
- Where’s the best place to ask for help?

Under the category titled "Help", you can find many channels suited for asking questions. Anything Roblox related belongs in the Roblox channels. Anything not related to Roblox’s goes in any channel applicable.

- Why am I not receiving help?

Usually, if you don’t ask your question properly, the community responds sarcastically. To avoid that, try to follow the tips in the Asking Good Questions section.

- Can I hire developers here?

The short answer is no. This is not a hiring community and is simply here for assistance in scripting. If you're looking for developers for hire, go to Hidden Developers or look on the Roblox DevForum.

- How do I obtain special roles like regular?

There isn’t a guaranteed method of getting them, as it’s not automated by the bot. You mainly obtain them by being active or meeting standards set by the staff, for information ask the staff team.
